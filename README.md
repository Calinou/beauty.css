# beauty.css

Makes your plain HTML pages less ugly and responsive.

## Usage

Include `beauty.min.css` in your HTML like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/beauty.min.css"/>
```

If you want your site to be responsive, you'll also need this, if it isn't
present already:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
```
